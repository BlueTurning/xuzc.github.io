##  To explore the hybrid intelligence of microscopic artifical systems 
This is **Zichen Xu** (1998/11), a fourth-year Phd student from the University of Macau, Faculty of Science and Technology, Department of Electromechanical Engineering. My supervisor is Prof. **Qingsong Xu**. 
My research focuses on developing microrobot system and platform that are wirelessly actuated and precisely controlled for assignments in constrain space. Physical intelligence inspired multi-scale robot design is also my focus, ranging from microscale to macroscale, such as biorobots, soft robots, microrobots, and so on. My work leverages multi-functional materials, micro physical interactions, advanced control methods, and bionic design factors to create magnetic actuation-based solution for next-generation clinical therapies. My primary interests are in **microrobot control and design**, **robotics and automation**, **soft robotics**, **lab-on-chip**, **medical engineering**, and **intelligent control for biomedical treatments** and **drug delivery**.

## 1. Microrobot Collectives for Biomedical Applications 
Single microrobots with limited volume have trouble in coping with complex tasks. Thus inpsired by natural collective behaviors, swarm intelligence is introduced to enhance the functionalities and abilities of single microrobot individuals. We have delved into the robust microrobot collective generation, deployment, and various applications. The advantages of my research is that the proposed collectives can generate the largest output forces for various assignments.(**ACS Nano 2022, Cell Reports Phyiscal Science 2023, Science Advances 2025**)

## 2. Active Delivery System within Human Body 
Internal environments within the human body is very complex. How to achieve active cargo delivery without loss is significant for various clinical treatment. We have proposed  a novel design of magnetic hydrogel soft capsule microrobots, which can be physically disintegrated to release microrobot swarms and diverse cargoes with almost no loss (**iScience 2023**). In the future, we will try to develop various oral robotic pills for personalized treatment.

Natural phyiscal interactions pave a new path to achieve multiple robotic functionalities. Abandoning traditional mechanical designs, hardware integration, or material preparation, natural microscopic phenomena provide valuable references to exploit intrinsic intelligence to accommodate complex environments. Bubbles are promising components for microrobotic designs (**Advanced Intelligent Systems 2024, Nano Letters 2024**).

## 4. Magnetic Soft Robotics Empower Tradition Medical Robotics
We report a design and utilization strategy of magnetic soft robots using a mixture of magnetic particles and non-Newtonian fluidic soft materials to produce programmable, hardened, adhesive, reconfigurable soft robots. For deployment, their ultrasoft structure and adhesion enable them to be spread on various surfaces, achieving magnetic actuation empowerment. The reported technology can potentially improve the functionality of robotic end-effectors and functional surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robots could help to grasp and actuate objects 300 times heavier than their weight. Furthermore, it is the first time we have enhanced the stiffness of mechanical structures for these soft materials by on-demand programmable hardening, enabling the robots to maximize force outputs. These findings offer a promising path to understanding, designing, and leveraging magnetic robots for more powerful applications (**Research 2023**).

## 5. Bio-inspired Soft Robotics
inspired by a natural multiple cilia structure, we propose an active entanglement soft gripper design. Exploiting the intrinsic shape changes of rubber hoses with a diameter of 2 mm, several (8 to 12) hoses can actively bend and wind together. The controlled shape changes are enabled by drawing thin strings inside the hoses that are fixed to the end of the hose. Such a flexible and multiple cilia-like actuation demonstrates attractive morphologically conforming to various objects. Without prior perception and sensing information, the proposed gripper naturally entangles designated objects by drawing the strings. Several experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed design. It has an almost 100% success rate of grasping objects of different sizes, structures, and masses. Overall, we demonstrate a unique design strategy, offering a novel paradigm that exploits physical ingenuity to promote soft robotic functionalities.

## 6. Precise Control of Microrobotic Systems
Microrobots have demonstrated attractive advantages for biomedical use, ranging from cargo delivery to invasive therapies. However, it remains a challenge to develop a universal control method for various microrobots to guarantee the precision of microrobot-based executions and further spread their applications. Herein, we propose an iterative learning control (ILC) method that can achieve precise position control for microrobots in a bionic flowing environment. Although the kinematics system of the microrobots and flowing environment has severe nonlinearities and uncertainties, the model- free control method, ILC, can optimize the input gradually to accurately accomplish microrobotsâ€™ arrangements, including position control and drug release. Oil-droplet-based magnetic soft microrobots are utilized as control objects to prove the advantages of the proposed control method. Two electro- magnets are set up as actuation devices, and a microchannel with a flowing medium mimics the vessel environment. By rigorous mathematical analysis and numerous experiments, the proposed method is verified to be effective, and the results show that the microrobots can be precisely controlled to the desired position in the flowing environment. These results pave a novel and accessible path to achieve precise position control for various microrobots.

## 7. Advanced Microfluidic Robotic Systems
Microfluidics has been applied in various fields by enabling precise control and manipulation of fluids at the microscale, thereby fostering the development of innovative lab-on-a-chip devices. This paper introduces a novel approach by integrating magnetic miniature robots with traditional microfluidic chips. These robots function as programmable devices capable of real-time, on-demand regulation within microfluidic systems. They excel in tasks such as reliable particle sorting, effective flow rate modulation, and precise flow direction control. They are achieved through the manipulation using external magnetic fields. The findings suggest using miniature magnetic robots as versatile tools to significantly enhance the functionality, precision, and adaptability of microfluidic systems. This research underscores the potential of magnetic miniature robots for advanced applications in microfluidics, paving the way for the development of increasingly complex and versatile microfluidic devices.

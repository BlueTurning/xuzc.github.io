##  To explore the hybrid intelligence of microscopic artifical systems 
This is **Zichen Xu**, a fourth-year Phd student from the University of Macau, Faculty of Science and Technology, Department of Electromechanical Engineering. My supervisor is Prof. **Qingsong Xu**. 
My research focuses on developing microrobot system and platform that are wirelessly actuated and precisely controlled for assignments in constrain space. Physical intelligence inspired multi-scale robot design is also my focus, ranging from microscale to macroscale, such as biorobots, soft robots, microrobots, and so on. My work leverages multi-functional materials, micro physical interactions, advanced control methods, and bionic design factors to create magnetic actuation-based solution for next-generation clinical therapies. My primary interests are in **microrobot control and design**, **robotics and automation**, **soft robotics**, **lab-on-chip**, **medical engineering**, and **intelligent control for biomedical treatments** and **drug delivery**.

## 1. Microrobot Collectives for Biomedical Applications 
Single microrobots with limited volume have trouble in coping with complex tasks. Thus inpsired by natural collective behaviors, swarm intelligence is introduced to enhance the functionalities and abilities of single microrobot individuals. I have delved into the robust microrobot collective generation, deployment, and various applications. The advantages of my research is that the proposed collectives can generate the largest output forces for various assignments.(ACS Nano 2022, Cell Reports Phyiscal Science 2023, Science Advances 2025)
